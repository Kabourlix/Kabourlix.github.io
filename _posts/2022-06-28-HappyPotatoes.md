During my 2nd year at IMT Atlantique, I had to make a group project in VR. The aim was to develop an immersive VR experience from scratch, in less than 3 months. In a team of 4, we : 
- Prototyped the experience : 
  - Imagined the outline of the experience
  - Designed the gaming experience and scenario
- Developped the experience itself
- Presented the result 

Such project has been carried out with **Unity** on an **Oculus Quest 2**.
Since we had little time to deal with this project, we have mainly used free asset available on the Unity Asset Store and focused on the logic of the game rather than its look. Let's take a look at what we have done.

## Prototyping

## Development

## The demo
Now is the time to get a look at our final result. Since we had little time to do this project and this was our first real big project, we only achieve at doing a working intro. But enough words, let's just watch what we got :
